263. Ugly NumberEasyAn ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

&nbsp;
Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3


Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.


Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	-231 &lt;= n &lt;= 231 - 1

 
```

##Code
 ```
  class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int n) {
        
        if(n == 0) return false;
        
        while(n%3==0) n = n/3;        
        while(n%5 == 0) n = n/5;        
        while(n%2==0) n = n/2;
        
        return n == 1;
    }
};
