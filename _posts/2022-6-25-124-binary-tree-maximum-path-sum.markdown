124. Binary Tree Maximum Path SumHardA path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

&nbsp;
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.


Example 2:

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
	-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000

 
```

##Code
 ```
  /**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int ans;
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {    
        ans = root->val;
        maxSum(root);
        
        return ans;
    }
    
    int maxSum(TreeNode* root){
  	    if(!root){
            return 0;
   	    }
    
	    int left  = maxSum(root->left);
        left =  left < 0 ?0:left;
        int right = maxSum(root->right);
        right  = right < 0 ? 0 : right;
        
        ans = max(root->val+left + right,ans);
        
        return root->val + max(left,right);
    }

};
