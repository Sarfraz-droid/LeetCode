740. Delete and EarnMediumYou are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:


	Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.


Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

&nbsp;
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2 * 104
	1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 104

 
```

##Code
 ```
  class Solution {
public:
    const int N = (1e5 + 1);
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> frequencyMap(N, 0);
        int dp[N];
        
        for(auto num : nums)
            frequencyMap[num]++;
        
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = frequencyMap[1];
        
        for(int i=2;i<N;i++)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-2]+i*frequencyMap[i], dp[i-1]);
        
      return dp[N-1];
    }
}; 
```
