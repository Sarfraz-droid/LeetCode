847. Shortest Path Visiting All NodesHardYou have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

&nbsp;
Example 1:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]


Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	n == graph.length
	1 &lt;= n &lt;= 12
	0 &lt;= graph[i].length &lt;&nbsp;n
	graph[i] does not contain i.
	If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
	The input graph is always connected.

  class Solution {
public:
    
    int solve(vector<vector<int>>&g){
        int n=g.size(); // Total n nodes from 0 to n-1
        // Let us suppose --> 
        /*
            We have 4 nodes : (labelled 0 to 3)
            if we have visited all nodes then all bits are set to 1.
            2^4 - 1 = 10000 - 1 = 1111 (ALL BITS ARE SET MEANS ALL 4 NODES(0 to 3) ARE VISITED)
            so at the end whenever our mask is equal to all (i.e mask == all) then we should return the answer.     
        */
        // instead of maintaining visited vector or set we will use bitmasking, because it will not give us TLE
        int all = (1 << n) - 1; // when we have visited all the nodes then our mask is equal to "all"
        queue<pair<int , pair<int, int>>>q; // { ith Node ,{dist, mask for keeping record of visited nodes from ith node}}
        set<pair<int, int>>vis;   // {ith node, mask}

                // result of above 2 masks by doing bitwise OR = 0011 (2 set bits means 2 nodes (i.e 0th and 1st are visited))
